# PROJECTS
A multi-layered anti-piracy system for cinema and OTT. Integrates AI (YOLO/Pi) for real-time device detection and Spread Spectrum Steganography for irrefutable forensic tracing. Our low-disadvantage design eliminates high-risk hardware, focusing on intelligent detection and future-proof digital evidence.

    Overview

This project presents a novel, three-layered security solution designed to combat illegal camcorder recording (cam-rips) in physical venues while maintaining critical relevance for the future of OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platforms. Our system minimizes the disadvantages of old hardware-based methods by integrating intelligent detection, low-disadvantage deterrence, and irrefutable forensic tracing to guarantee accountability for every leak.

The Three-Layer Architecture

Layer 1: Intelligent Deterrence & Intervention (Physical Countermeasure)

This layer focuses on actively interfering with the camera's ability to record without resorting to high-power, audience-risking radiation.

Goal: Stop the recording act using a low-disadvantage physical signal.

Mechanism: Instead of using dangerous high-power IR, this layer employs a controlled optical patterning or digital flicker within the visible spectrum. This signal is designed to conflict with the camera's fixed frame rate, causing flickering bands or rolling shutter effects in the pirated video without harming the audience.

Layer 2: Real-Time Detection and Alert System

This is our active, AI-powered surveillance layer, designed for rapid intervention.

Technology: Raspberry Pi (Edge Computing) running an optimized YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model.

Function: A camera continuously monitors the audience. The YOLO model is trained to accurately identify the shape and orientation of unauthorized recording devices (phones, camcorders) in real-time.

Impact: Provides instant, precise, time-stamped alerts to security personnel, enabling immediate human intervention to stop the piracy in progress.

Layer 3: Forensic Tracing (The Future-Proof Defense)

This is the most critical and enduring component, ensuring irrefutable evidence is embedded into the content itself.

Technology: Highly robust Spread Spectrum Steganography (a digital watermarking algorithm).

Mechanism: A unique, invisible tracing ID (containing the Venue ID and Timestamp, or Subscriber Account ID for OTT streams) is mathematically spread across the entire video data. This method makes the watermark highly resistant to removal, compression, or filtering.

Impact: If a pirated copy is found, the watermark is extracted to irrefutably trace the file back to the source of the leak, transforming the pirated file into actionable legal evidence against the infringer.

Key Advantages & Future Scope

Low Disadvantage Design: The architecture avoids high-power, high-risk physical hardware, eliminating concerns about eye damage, heat, and regulatory risks that plague traditional IR systems.

Irrefutable Accountability: By guaranteeing the source of the leak, the system shifts the industry from imperfect prevention to reliable forensic prosecution.

OTT Scalability: Layer 3 is perfectly scalable. It can pivot from marking a theater to marking individual subscriber accounts, making it the essential anti-piracy tool for future streaming platforms.
